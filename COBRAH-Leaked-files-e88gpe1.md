COBRAH's breakthrough exhibition came in 2015, when she showcased her work at the Saatchi Gallery in London. The exhibition, titled "Reflections," featured a series of large-scale paintings that explored the theme of self-reflection. The exhibition was a critical and commercial success, with many art critics praising COBRAH's unique artistic vision and her ability to connect with viewers on a deep emotional level. Since her breakthrough exhibition, COBRAH has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. COBRAH has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016.
